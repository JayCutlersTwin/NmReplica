                                    Netmatters use a paid for software on our website which allows us access to information on the company you work for. This is done through the business' registered IP address and only allows us access to the information such as contact details, year founded, SIC codes and other information about the business. It also records the behaviour of the user from the company on the website, such as page views, time on the site, "goals" completed and other similar metrics. We use this data to help us improve lead generation through the website as this tool allows us access to see which businesses have visited the website but have not converted by calling, emailing or sending a contact form.
